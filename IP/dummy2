-About

Hi I'm Arpan. I have 5 years of experience on the .Net platform working as a Core Software Engineer and later as a Team Lead 
in AmpleLogic.

Since the last 2 years I have been working as a Team Lead at AmpleLogic. During this time I have been associated with 3 major 
projects. The main product of the company is RAD tool, second product is for Lifesciences industry and last is a service based 
engagement for a MES system for Semiconductor industry. My responsibilities for this role include presales talks, timelines 
estimations, Project design & development , monitor team productivity, defect mangement ,release mangement and recruitment.

I am passionate about technology and always looking for challenges and new learnings. I was awarded Best Employee 
Of The Year 2012 for my contributions to the main product of the company. Also as a Team Lead I am scheduled to travel to US this
month for the Go-Live of the MES System at the client's place.

In the last 5 years I have learnt a lot and grown at a rapid pace. Currently I feel my career is stagnating. 
Hence I am looking for an oppurtunity in a more mature organisation where I can face new challenges and continue my learnings.
